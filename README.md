# Python-SciPy-Tutorial
SciPy is a scientific computation library that uses NumPy underneath.  SciPy stands for Scientific Python.  It provides more utility functions for optimization, stats and signal processing.  Like NumPy, SciPy is open source so we can use it freely.  SciPy was created by NumPy's creator Travis Olliphant.

# Install SciPy using pip

We can install the SciPy library by using the pip command. Pip is basically a recursive acronym which stands for ‘Pip Installs Packages’. It is a standard package manager which can be installed in most of the operating systems. To install, run the following command in the terminal:

<code> pip install scipy  </code>

# Install SciPy using Anaconda

We can also install SciPy packages by using Anaconda. First, we need to download the Anaconda navigator and then open the anaconda prompt type the following command:

<code> conda install -c anaconda scipy  </code>

# Install on Mac

The mac doesn’t have the preinstall package manager, but you can install various popular package managers. Run the following commands in the terminal it will download the SciPy as well as matplotlib, pandas, NumPy.

<code> sudo port install py35-numpy py35-scipy py35-matplotlib py35-ipython +notebook py35-pandas py35-sympy py35-nose    </code>
